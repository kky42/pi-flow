# pi-flow

Multi-backend subagents and dynamic workflow orchestration for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi).

`pi-flow` gives pi two coordination primitives:

- **`Agent`** — launch one fresh subagent for a scoped task.
- **`workflow`** — run a small trusted JavaScript workflow that fans work out through many subagents, optionally across different agent harnesses.

Supported subagent backends:

- **Pi** child sessions
- **Codex CLI** via `codex exec`
- **Claude Code** via `claude -p`

```bash
pi install npm:@kky42/pi-flow
```

## Why pi-flow?

A single agent harness is good at many tasks, but hard problems often benefit from **parallel context gathering**, **adversarial review**, and **model diversity**. `pi-flow` lets the pi main agent route each lane to the backend that fits best.

```

Use it when you want to:

1. **Add subagents and dynamic workflows to pi.** Delegate repository exploration, broad search, review, and synthesis to fresh isolated child agents.
2. **Mix Pi, Codex, and Claude Code backends.** Different harnesses and models have different tool behavior, prompts, strengths, and blind spots. Combining them can improve adversarial review, idea generation, and complex problem solving.
3. **Scale wide fan-out without losing inspectability.** Large audits and research tasks can be split into many bounded subagent lanes. The extension queues lanes under a shared concurrency cap and surfaces progress in the TUI.
4. **Use each subscription/model where it shines.** Example routing:
   - internet/resource-heavy search → Codex + a fast GPT model
   - frontend or product UI work → Claude Code + Opus/Sonnet
   - local file summarization → Pi + DeepSeek V4 Flash
   - backend implementation → Pi + a stronger coding model

## Define subagents

`pi-flow` ships two profiles:

- `general-purpose` — broad research, code search, and multi-step investigation.
- `explorer` — fast read-only repository mapping and reference search.

Add your own profiles as Markdown files in `~/.pi/agent/subagents/<name>.md`. The filename becomes the `subagent_type` used by `Agent` and workflow `agent()` calls.

```md
---
description: Reviews backend changes with local pi tools.
backend: pi
tools: read, grep, find, bash
model: inherit
thinking: high
---

You are a careful backend reviewer. Focus on correctness, tests, and regressions.
```

Frontmatter fields:

- `description` — required; shown in pi's available-agent roster.
- `backend` — `pi` (default), `codex`, or `claude`.
- `tools` — pi backend only; child-session tool allowlist. `Agent` and `workflow` are always removed from pi-backed children.
- `model` / `thinking` — optional; use `inherit` or a backend-supported value.
- Markdown body — profile prompt appended to the selected backend.

External backend examples:

```md
---
description: Broad code review through Codex CLI.
backend: codex
model: gpt-5.4-mini
thinking: high
---

Review the diff for correctness, missed edge cases, and test gaps.
```

```md
---
description: UI and product review through Claude Code.
backend: claude
model: opus
thinking: high
---

Review frontend changes for UX, accessibility, and architecture regressions.
```

External profiles run local CLI commands in no-approval mode (`codex exec ... --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, `claude ... --dangerously-skip-permissions`). Use them only in trusted repositories.

## Use subagents

Ask pi naturally:

```text
Explore this repo with the explorer subagent, then summarize the important files.
```

Or call the tool shape directly from an agent/tooling context:

```ts
Agent({
  description: "Explore repo",
  subagent_type: "explorer",
  prompt: "Map the project purpose, key directories, scripts, tests, and caveats. Do not edit files.",
});
```

Subagents start fresh in the same working directory. Parent messages and tool results are not inherited, so prompts should be self-contained.

## Use workflows

Use `workflow` when a task should fan out to several subagents, use different backends, or synthesize multiple independent findings.

You normally do **not** write workflow files by hand. Ask pi in natural language and the main agent can create the workflow, run it, and summarize the result:

```text
Run a workflow to review this PR from several independent angles and synthesize the findings.
```

If you want to reuse a workflow, ask pi to save it:

```text
Create and save a reusable workflow for release review, then run it on this repo.
```

Saved workflows are trusted JavaScript under the hood. Global workflows live in `~/.pi/agent/workflows/*.js`; trusted project workflows live in `.pi/workflows/*.js`. After a workflow is saved, invoke it by name in natural language. Inline workflow runs can also be resumed by replay from the returned `scriptPath` and `runId`.

## Runtime guardrails

Direct `Agent` calls and workflow `agent()` calls share one global concurrency cap and one wall-clock timeout guardrail:

```bash
pi --max-concurrent-subagents 4 --subagent-timeout-ms 600000
```

Set `--subagent-timeout-ms` to `0` to disable the timeout. Values are milliseconds.
